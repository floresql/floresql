# Welcome to My Software Engineering Journey! ðŸŽ‰

## Overview

Hello there! ðŸ‘‹ After a hiatus from the software engineering world, I'm back and ready to dive into the exciting realm of coding once again. This will be a journey of rediscovery, learning new technologies, and brushing up on old skills. But just like riding a bicycle ðŸš², once you get back on, it all starts coming back to you.

## ðŸ“– Background 

In my previous life as a full-stack web developer, I thrived on the challenge of building interactive and engaging web applications. However, as time passed, I found myself leveraging technology to extract meaningful insights in roles as a business intelligence developer and manager of analytics where I discovered the power of tools like SQL and Python for data manipulation and analysis. Visualizing data has become second nature, allowing me to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Currently, I find myself immersed in the dynamic field of business planning & analysis ðŸ“Š, where I combine my technical expertise with strategic thinking to drive informed decision-making. It's a fascinating intersection of technology and business, where I leverage my coding skills alongside financial modeling and forecasting techniques. But is it enough?

## âŒ¨ Why I'm Back 

The allure of software engineering never truly faded away. Despite the detour into data analysis and business intelligence, the core excitement of crafting elegant solutions and building impactful applications remained alive within me. ðŸ¤“ The itch to tinker with code, solve complex problems, and collaborate with like-minded individuals never waned.

Moreover, the fast-paced evolution of technology constantly presents new challenges and opportunities. The prospect of diving back into the world of software engineering, armed with fresh perspectives and enriched experiences from my detour, excites me beyond measure. I see this return not just as a reunion with a former passion but as a continuation of a journey towards personal and professional growth.

## ðŸš€ Here we go! 

As I dust off my coding skills and embrace the ever-evolving landscape of technology, I expect and interesting and engaging journey of growth and exploration. This account will serve as a living testament to my journey, documenting the projects, challenges, and triumphs along the way. From simple experiments to ambitious undertakings, each step will bring me closer to realizing my full potential as a software engineer once again.
